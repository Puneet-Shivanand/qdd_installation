QDD-2.3
1. Can work with Primer3 version 1 or 2. Set primer3_version to 1 or 2 to choose.
2. Motifs with circular permutation and reverse complementary sequences grouped together 
(e.g. AAC for AAC, ACA, CAA, TTG, TGT, and GTT). In earlier version there was a bug 
in grouping the wrong motifs together, for some of the tri-hexa nucleotide motifs. 

QDD-3.0
1. Version can run under Galaxy
1. Can accept contigs as input
2. Multithreading for BLAST+
3. Can run RepeatMasker in pipe4
4. Contamination check against the nt database of NCBI can be run
either by remote BLAST or by local BLAST is the nt database has been downloaded 
5. Select One primer pair according to the results of wet-lab tests 
(previously the lowest primer pair penality was selected)

QDD-3.1
1. Can accept fastq files as input
2. Recognises automatically wheter executable name is clustalw or clustalw2
3. Print out fasta files with 100 bp per line
4. Windows version can also work with Primer3v2.3.6 (add tag PRIMER_THERMODYNAMIC_PARAMETERS_PATH)
5. ncbi_tax.pl can be run from any folder in linux

QDD-3.1.1
Bug corrected: The columns PCR_PRODUCT_SEQ and PCR_PRIMER_ALIGNSCORE in the primer table were erroneous in QDD3.1 

QDD-3.1.2
1. Calculate the PCR_PRIMER_ALIGNSCORE between the sequences and the primers and not between the PCR product and the primers as previously.
2. PCR_PRODUCT_SEQ: gives the longest possible PCR product (if multiple exact matches between primers and sequence)
3. PCR_PRODUCT_SIZE: length of the longest possible PCR product
4. PRIMER_LEFT_DIST_FROM_MS, PRIMER_RIGHT_DIST_FROM_MS, PRIMER_LEFT_FIRTS_POS, PRIMER_RIGHT_FIRTS_POS, MIN_PRIMER_TARGET_DIST: gives info on the shortest possible PCR product
